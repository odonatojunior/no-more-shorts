  <h1>No More Shorts</h1>

I don't like that you can't skip time watching Shorts, so I made an extension that redirects the current video to the good old player

# Installation

Check the releases tab on Github and download the zip file

Load the packed _.zip_ file into your Chrome extensions tab and get rid of this unskippable video format

# Examples

If it doesn't redirect you automatically just click the button in the context menu and it'll do it
